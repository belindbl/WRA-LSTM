This is a project aiming to recreate the paper by [Bolarinwa et al.](https://repository.uel.ac.uk/item/8wxxy) by utilising Pose Estimation in conjunction with an RNN to classify liftts into 4 categories: Good Snatch, Bad Snatch, Good Clean and Jerk, and Bad Clean and Jerk.

##Tools:
- OpenPose
- TensorFlow: pre-made models and layers
